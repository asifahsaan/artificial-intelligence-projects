Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to detect and classify human emotions from facial images using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes facial expressions and predicts emotions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc. This project demonstrates the use of computer vision and classification algorithms in real-world emotion recognition tasks.
