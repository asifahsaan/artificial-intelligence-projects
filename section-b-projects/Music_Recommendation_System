This project focuses on analyzing a Spotify music dataset to understand musical characteristics and predict song popularity using machine learning techniques.
Various audio features such as valence, energy, acousticness, and tempo are analyzed to identify patterns in music trends.
The system also classifies songs based on mood and acoustic nature, providing meaningful insights into listener preferences. 
The results of this study can be used as a foundation for developing intelligent music recommendation systems in the future.
