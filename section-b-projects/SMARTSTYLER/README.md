Fashion Image Recommendation System
This project is an AI-based fashion product recommendation system that suggests visually similar fashion items using image features.
What this project does
Takes a fashion product image as input
Extracts deep visual features using a CNN model
Finds similar products using cosine similarity
Shows Top 5 recommended products with images
New Feature Added
To improve the previous version, this project now includes:
Similarity + Diversity recommendations
Very similar products
Slightly different but related products
Similarity explanation for each recommendation
(e.g. Very High Visual Similarity, High Visual Similarity)
This makes the system more realistic and user-friendly.
