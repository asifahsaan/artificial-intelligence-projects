# SmartStyler – AI-Based Fashion Recommendation System

## Project Title
SmartStyler – AI-Based Fashion Recommendation System

## Student Name(s)

## Problem Statement
Online fashion platforms provide a wide variety of clothing and accessories, which makes it difficult for users to find items that match their personal style and visual preferences. Traditional keyword-based search systems often fail to capture visual similarity such as color, texture, and design.  
SmartStyler addresses this problem by using Artificial Intelligence to recommend visually similar fashion items based on image features, making the shopping experience faster, more personalized, and user-friendly.

## Dataset Source
Fashion Product Images Dataset (Kaggle):  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset
(https://www.kaggle.com/code/ridathemalik/image-recommender-system-using-deep-approach/edit)

## Model / Technique Used
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction  
- Pre-trained CNN model to extract deep visual features from images  
- Cosine Similarity to measure similarity between fashion items  
- Image-based recommendation approach

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Install required libraries such as TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV, and Scikit-learn.
4. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and set the dataset path in the notebook.
5. Run all cells sequentially.
6. Provide an image ID or input image to get visually similar fashion recommendations.

## Results
- The system successfully recommends visually similar fashion items.
- Similarity scores are calculated using cosine similarity.
- High similarity scores indicate strong visual resemblance.
- Screenshots of input images and recommended outputs are included in the results section/folder.
