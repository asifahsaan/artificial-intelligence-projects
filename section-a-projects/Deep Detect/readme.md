Project Title: Deep Detect
Student Name: Muhammad Usman Ali
Problem Statement: AI-generated images are becoming increasingly indistinguishable from real photographs. Manual identification of such images is unreliable, time-consuming, and prone to error, especially when large volumes of data are involved. Traditional image processing and machine learning methods rely on handcrafted features, which often fail to capture the complex patterns introduced by modern generative models.
