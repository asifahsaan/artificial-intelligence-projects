## 📌 Project Overview
Cricket performance prediction plays an important role in modern sports analytics by helping teams and analysts make informed decisions.  
This project focuses on predicting a cricket player’s **batting performance** using **machine learning techniques** based on historical data.

The system analyzes past batting records such as runs scored, strike rate, balls faced, and match history to predict **future batting performance**. The project demonstrates how machine learning can support selectors, coaches, and analysts in performance evaluation and strategic planning.

## 🧠 Abstract
This project predicts a cricket player’s batting performance using machine learning models. Historical batting data is collected and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency. Multiple machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated to identify patterns in batting performance. The results show that machine learning can effectively analyze cricket data and provide meaningful predictions, helping in better decision-making for team selection and strategy.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze historical batting performance data of cricket players  
- Predict future batting performance using machine learning  
- Compare different ML models for accuracy  
- Understand player consistency and performance trends  
- Demonstrate the application of ML in sports analytics
