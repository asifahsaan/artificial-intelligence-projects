Project Title: Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks



Student Name(s): Bilal Shabbir (70139957), Aleena Rauf (70134419)



Problem Statement: Brain tumors pose serious health risks, and early detection is essential for effective treatment.

Traditional diagnosis relies heavily on radiologists manually examining MRI scans, which is

time-intensive and prone to subjective interpretation. With the increasing number of medical

images generated daily, there is a need for an automated and reliable system that can accurately

detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images. This project aims to address this problem by

applying deep learning techniques to improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy.
