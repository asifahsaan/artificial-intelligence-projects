Problem Statement
Early detection of plant diseases is difficult using manual inspection. This project uses Artificial Intelligence to automatically identify plant diseases from leaf images, helping farmers reduce crop loss.

Dataset Source
PlantVillage Dataset (Kaggle):  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease

Model / Technique Used
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Deep Learning
