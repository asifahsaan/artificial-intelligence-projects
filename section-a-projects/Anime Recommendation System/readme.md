## Dataset Source
Anime Dataset (anime.csv)  
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database

## Model / Technique Used
- Content-Based Recommendation System  
- TF-IDF Vectorization  
- Cosine Similarity  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
